If you have a 4.3BSD vax, a Sun, or a Sequent running Dynix 3.04 (or >)
you should be able to type "make install" and have your existing ftp
daemon replaced. Other systems may require some modifications.

Temporary fix: if you remove the program "/etc/ftpd", you're safe.
However, ftp TO your site will be unavailable.  This package is
replacement source for the program ftpd.

This package requires the inetd program.  If you're not running
inetd, it won't help you.  Just remove /etc/ftpd, and contact us
for more information.

One of the fixes to this ftpd is that if a username has a shell
specified in /etc/passwd that is NOT listed in /etc/shells, they
will not be able to log in. You can add any local login shells to the
file /etc/shells with your favorite editor.
